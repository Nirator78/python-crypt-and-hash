# Python Encryption and Hashing
A little repository of my learning process about encryption and hashing with simple example

## Encryption

- Understanding the basic concept of encryption
- Example (using `cryptography` library) -> `encryption-1.py`
- Understanding the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Example (using `rsa` library) -> `encryption-2.py`

## Hashing

- Understanding the basic concept of hashing
- Example (using `hashlib` library) -> `hashing-1.py`
- Understanding the difference between encryption and hashing
- Example (using `hashlib` library) -> `hashing-2.py`
